# Rust By Example

In this repo I'm documenting my progress as I follow along with the [Rust by Example](http://rustbyexample.com/) ebook. Coming from a JavaScript background and working pretty much exclusively in Node, I find myself getting more and more interested in things like manual memory management, concurrency, native apps, and systems programming as I get to know the inner workings of JS better. What better way to learn all of that than by learning Rust?

I will be a Rustacean yet!
